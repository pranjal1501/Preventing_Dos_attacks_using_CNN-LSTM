# Preventing_Dos_attacks_using_CNN-LSTM
This repository contains a security analysis system for Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) devices to detect DoS attacks in real-time. Using a CNN-LSTM edge model for fast detection and cloud-based validation, it ensures efficient, secure communication with minimal false positives. AES encryption is applied for data transmission
