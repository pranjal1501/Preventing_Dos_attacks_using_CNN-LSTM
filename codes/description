preprocess_dataset_create_csv_from_text: 
This script reads raw network traffic data from a text file inside the dataset folder, and processes it to create a structured CSV file. It also applies MinMax normalization to scale the values of 39 selected attributes, ensuring that the data is consistent for analysis and machine learning. This normalization helps enhance visualization and improves model performance by ensuring all attributes are on the same scale.

mean_analysis:
This script calculates the mean values of selected attributes from the dataset. The user can modify both the number of random data points to be sampled and the specific attributes to focus on. This analysis provides insights into traffic patterns and the overall behavior of both normal and attack traffic within the dataset.

plot_graphs:
This script generates visual representations of network traffic attributes. You can customize the number of data points to visualize, making it easier to see how different features change between normal and DoS attack scenarios. The graphs provide a clear comparison of the values and behavior of different traffic attributes.

extract_data_from_wireshark_csvfile:
This script processes the packet data extracted from Wireshark and converts it into a format compatible with the dataset used to train the CNN-LSTM model. The conversion ensures that the data fields from Wireshark, such as source and destination bytes, flags, and error rates, align with the predefined structure of the model's dataset, facilitating seamless analysis and attack detection. This step is crucial for testing real-time network traffic against the trained model.

These files play an essential role in preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization, contributing to both training and evaluating the CNN-LSTM model for DoS attack detection.
